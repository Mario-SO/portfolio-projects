Description This project consists of a web app that can be used to check the price of an NFT floor price, specifically the floor price of the Space Poggers collection.
During the time that the NFT project was in development, the web app showed updates in real-time thanks to the API provided by OpenSea but due to high demand and requests that were made by the collectors of the NFT project, rate limits were surpassed and i could afford anymore mantaining the web app, so for some time, updates on price were done manually.</description></item><item><title>Getting ETH balance from the command line using rust ðŸ¦€</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/fastbalancegetter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:35:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/fastbalancegetter/</guid><description>Links ðŸ‘‰ Repo ðŸ‘ˆ
