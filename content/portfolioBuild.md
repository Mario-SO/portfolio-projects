## Description
This project was created to showcase my skills and highlghts as a developer. It consists of a **main website** used as a *link in bio*-like with all my relevant links and information.

Among those links are the following:
- My blog
- This projects website
- My CV 

Also some social media just in case it is easier for someone to contact me directly through them, and my email.

# Phases
This project has gone through several phases where I was struggling how to make it both look good and be functional enough for a recruiter to see my work.

## Phase 1 - Testing the grounds
![first](/projectsV2.png)

I knew I wanted a website that was simple and easy to use, so I started with the classical grid layout with some photos and links. The style was a bit of a mess 🥴, but I liked the *cartoonish* style of the cards so I iterated on it a couple of times.

Simple iteration on the color pallate and size of cards so it was more mobile friendly.

## Phase 2 - Mobile friendly + Navigation

More color pallete 🎨 changes and the addition of a navbar. At this point i wasn't very happy with how it was turning out, so I decided to make it mor like a blog and lees of a simple card layout.

## Phase 3 - Complete redesign

And here are we now 🥳. This is the final version of the projects page and I think it was the best decision to make.

This format lets me approach my projects in a way tat I can document them and have a history of my train of thought at the moment of making them.

## Phase 4 - To the point
Even though this seems like a lot of thinking and rethinking, now comes the most important part, what technology to use.

As I ended up liking much more the ***blog*** 📝 style, I decided to use a *static site generator* called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is the same one I use on my blog.

I had the design, so it was only a matter of using the same one both in my blog and projects page (*the projects page design came before the blog 😅*).
