## Description
This project consists of a **web app** that can be used to check the price of an NFT floor price, specifically the floor price of the [Space Poggers](https://opensea.io/collection/spacepoggers) collection.

During the time that the NFT project was in development, the web app showed updates in real-time thanks to the API provided by OpenSea but due to high demand and requests that were made by the collectors of the NFT project, rate limits were surpassed and i could afford anymore mantaining the web app, so for some time, updates on price were done manually.


### Technologies Used
